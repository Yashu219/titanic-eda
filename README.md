# Titanic EDA
### Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and identify patterns using statistics and visualizations.

### Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### Steps Performed
1. Loaded and cleaned the Titanic dataset
2. Performed summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)
3. Visualized data:
   - Histograms (Age)
   - Boxplots (Fare)
   - Countplots (Survived, Pclass)
   - Correlation heatmap
4. Made basic feature-level inferences

### Key Observations
- Age is slightly right-skewed
- Fare has several outliers
- Survival rate is higher in 1st class than in 3rd class
- Strong correlation exists between `Pclass` and `Fare`

### Dataset Source
[Titanic Dataset â€“ Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

### Outcome
This analysis was completed as part of Task 2 in the **Elevate Labs AI & ML Internship**.
